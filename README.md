# Presidential-Inaugural-Address-Analysis
This code performs sentiment analysis on every US President inaugural address since 1789. The results are then graphed â€” points that are higher up on the graph represent that the corresponding inaugural address was more "happy". The graph correlates closely with American history; for example, the two least happy inagurual addresses occured during the devastating US Civil War. Similarly, the happiest inaugural address happened immediately after the War of 1812, the result of which reaffirmed US independence from Great Britain and was a cause of great celebration in the US.
